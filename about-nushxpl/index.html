    <h1>nushXPL</h1>
    <p>
        nushXPL is a tool for me to frame certain sites directly into my web page for me to share with classmates. This allows me to give a link to this site to others, with the confidence that I can update the underlying frame URL if I ever need to.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is especially useful for some of my sites like <a href="https://gohjy.github.io/timelines">Timelines</a> or my <a href="https://gohjy.github.io/event-details">event details tool</a>, where the data is stored in the URL itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        nushXPL is a single-page web application - the page displayed is determined by the hash fragment (i.e. the bit in the URL after the #/ characters).
    </p>

        (The XPL in nushXPL doesn't actually have a meaning; I just picked a random unpronounceable combination of three letters.)
